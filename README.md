# -Bullwhip-Case-Study-using-Human-Robot-and-LLM-based-Stimulations.
This repository contains a simulation-based case study on the Bullwhip Effect using the Beer Game. It compares human decision-making, rule-based robotic agents, and large language model (LLM) agents under baseline, lean, information-sharing, and combined scenarios, with structured analysis, figures, and reproducible experiments.
